# Site Map

This is a custom interactive visualisation of my site's structure using D3.js. It's organised as a hierarchy with the home page as the root on the left, and sub-pages branching off each page. Each node is clickable, and takes you to the corresponding page or section. Nodes are red and pulse by default; they turn grey and still when the page has been visited by the user already.

Some of the nodes are synthetic pages which represent sections of a larger "hub" page. For example, the puzzles node has several children representing different types of puzzle: each one has its own children which are the puzzle pages themselves.

The full structure of the map can be found in map.json. This file is automatically generated. Nodes with `"display": false` are not shown. An alternative view of how the map looks can be found below in this tree.
