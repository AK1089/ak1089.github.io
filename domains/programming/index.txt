## The Programming Section

Here's where I put everything on here to do with programming, in no particular order. Mostly about Python.

<ul>
- [Weird Python Quirks and Oddities](python-quirks) - Some ostensibly bizarre behaviours of Python that I find interesting
- [Where The Hell Does 42 Come From?](python-quirks/floating-points-and-42) - An investigation into a floating-point error
</ul>
