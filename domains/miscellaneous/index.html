<p>Okay, you got me. I have nothing here. Here's my to-do list for somewhat large-scale projects. It's "public" (though I expect very few people to actually read it) so I have some incentive to follow through on them, but there's no specific deadline for most of these nor are they in any coherent priority order.</p>
<p><ul>
<li>Redo the templates and boilerplate for the website, to make it load faster and work better on mobile.</li>
<li>Completely rewrite <span class="tooltip">Spotify Scripting<span class="tooltiptext">My custom scripting language designed to write hyper-custom nondeterministic Spotify playlists.</span></span>. Possibly also integrate it with the digital cassette player, and make a webpage for it.</li>
<li>Make an <span class="tooltip">interactive autofilling map<span class="tooltiptext">A map-like graphic which would show a directed graph of all the subpages of this website by which link to each other, with a fog-of-war effect whereby each page is partially revealed only once you visit a parent of it.</span></span> of this website</li>
<li>Add all the old projects like the Dijkstra's algorithm demonstration, word games, etc. onto this site.</li>
<li>Create <span class="tooltip">mini control boxes<span class="tooltiptext">Tiny, unit-cheap boxes each with a button and a microphone which take instructions and do things with them.</span></span> for my house.</li>
<li>Make a mechanical table which can switch surfaces to be a dining table, board game area, crafts surface etc. simultaneously.</li>
<li>Finish the <span class="tooltip">in-progress Minr maps<span class="tooltiptext">This list currently includes Claude, Task Mansion, Password Game, Samsara, Readme, Don't Look Back 2, Four, Murder Mystery, Interior Design, and Zura.</span></span>, as well as possibly others.</li>
<li>Create and run that elaborate puzzle hunt I've been planning (no spoilers!)</li>
<li>Set up the perfect LaTeX boilerplate & environment for notes and problem sheets, and type up & publicise all of those for third year.</li>
</ul>
