## Miscellaneous Stuff

Okay, you got me. I have nothing here. Here's my to-do list for somewhat large-scale projects. It's "public" (though I expect very few people to actually read it) so I have some incentive to follow through on them, but there's no specific deadline for most of these nor are they in any coherent priority order.

<ul>
- Completely rewrite [Spotify Scripting](!My custom scripting language designed to write hyper-custom nondeterministic Spotify playlists.). Possibly also integrate it with the digital cassette player, and make a webpage for it.
- Add all the old projects like the Dijkstra's algorithm demonstration, word games, etc. onto this site.
- Create [mini control boxes](!Tiny, unit-cheap boxes each with a button and a microphone which take instructions and do things with them.) for my house.
- Make a mechanical table which can switch surfaces to be a dining table, board game area, crafts surface etc. simultaneously.
- Finish the [in-progress Minr maps](!This list currently includes Claude, Task Mansion, Password Game, Samsara, Readme, Don't Look Back 2, Four, Murder Mystery, Interior Design, and Zura.), as well as possibly others.
- Create and run that elaborate puzzle hunt I've been planning (no spoilers!)
- Take typeset LaTeX notes for all my courses & publicise all of them for third year.
</ul>

Here are some more things which were originally on this list, but are no longer any more, because I finished them.

<ul>
- Redo the templates and boilerplate for the website, to make it load faster and work better on mobile.
- Make an [interactive autofilling map](!A map-like graphic which would show a directed graph of all the subpages of this website by which link to each other, with a fog-of-war effect whereby each page is partially revealed only once you visit a parent of it.) of this website
- Set up the perfect LaTeX boilerplate & environment for notes and problem sheets.
</ul>
