## Electromagnetism Notes

### Basics: Charge, Current, and Fields

The strength of the electromagnetic force experienced by a particle is proportional to its *charge*, measured in Coulombs. Here, we assume this charge takes values in \( \mathbb{R} \), but in reality this is quantised: charges must be integer multiples of the [fundamental charge](!The electron has charge \&#40;-e\&#41;.) \(e \approx 1.6 \times 10^{-19} \; \mathrm{C}\).

The *charge density* \( \rho(\mathbf{x}, t) \) is the charge per unit volume. The total charge in a region \(V\) is therefore
\[ Q = \int_V \rho(\mathbf{x}, t) \text{d}V \]
This might be expressed in terms of sheets or lines instead, as a 2D or 1D integral.

For any surface \( S \),
\[ I = \int_S \mathbf{J} \cdot \text{d}S \]
is the current, where \( \mathbf{J} \) is the *current density*.

If the charge \( \rho(\mathbf{x}, t) \) has velocity \( \mathbf{v}(\mathbf{x}, t) \), then the current density [is fairly obviously](!ignoring relativistic effects) \( \rho \mathbf{v} \).

Charge is conserved. More specifically, it is [conserved *locally*](!Global conservation of charge only means the total charge in all of space is constant. We also require that a charge here can't disappear and instantly reappear on Jupiter, say.): it can only change due to continuous currents. This gives rise to the *continuity equation*:
\[ \frac{\partial \rho}{\partial t} + \nabla \cdot \mathbf{J} = 0 \]
Note that, by our definition of charge and the [divergence theorem](!\&#40; \int_V \nabla \cdot \mathbf{F} \text{ d}V= \int_{\partial V} \mathbf{F} \cdot \text{d}\mathbf{S} \&#41;), the charge \( Q \) in some region \( V \) satisfies
\[ \frac{\text{d} \rho}{\text{d} t} = \int_V \frac{\partial \rho}{\partial t} \text{d}V = - \int_V \nabla \cdot \mathbf{J} \text{d}V = - \int_S \mathbf{J} \cdot \text{d}S \]
If we take \( V = \mathbb{R}^3 \), the whole of space, then assuming there are no currents at infinity, \( Q' = 0 \) (global conservation of charge).

A field is a function from \( \mathbb{R}^3 \times \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}^3 \text{ or } \mathbb{R} \). It assigns each point in time and space a vector or scalar quantity. We have the [electric and magnetic fields](!These are both *vector* fields: they assign each point a 3D vector showing the direction of the field.) \( \mathbf{E}(\mathbf{x}, t) \) and \( \mathbf{B}(\mathbf{x}, t) \).

Fields cause particles to move according to the *Lorentz Force Law*:
\[ \mathbf{F} = q(\mathbf{E} + \mathbf{v} \times \mathbf{B} ) \]
We also have [Maxwell's equations](!Named for James Clerk Maxwell, who published them in 1865.):
\[ \begin{align&#42;} \nabla \cdot \mathbf{E} &= \frac{\rho}{\varepsilon_0} \\ \nabla \cdot \mathbf{B} &= 0 \\ \nabla \times \mathbf{E} + \frac{\partial \mathbf{B}}{\partial t} &= 0 \\ \nabla \times \mathbf{B} - \mu_0 \varepsilon_0 \frac{\partial \mathbf{E}}{\partial t} &= \mu_0 \mathbf{J} \end{align&#42;} \]
These use the constants [\( \mu_0 \)](!Known as the magnetic constant, or *permeability of free space*.) \( = 4 \pi \times 10^{-6} \; \mathrm{m} \; \mathrm{kg} \; \mathrm{C}^{-2} \) and [\( \varepsilon_0 \)](!Known as the electric constant, or *permittivity of free space*.) \( = 8.85 \pi \times 10^{-12} \; \mathrm{m}^{-3} \; \mathrm{kg}^{-1} \; \mathrm{s}^{-2} \; \mathrm{C}^2 \).
