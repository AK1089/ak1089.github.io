## Electromagnetism Notes

The strength of the electromagnetic force experienced by a particle is proportional to its *charge*, measured in Coulombs. Here, we assume this charge takes values in $$\mathbb{R}$$, but in reality this is quantised: charges must be integer multiples of the fundamental charge $$e \approx 1.6 \times 10^{-19}$$C. The electron has charge $$-e$$.

The \textbf{charge density} is the charge per unit volume. The total charge in a region $$V$$ is therefore
\[ Q = \int_V \rho(\mathbf{x}, t) \text{d}V \]
