<p>An element \(r\) in an <span class="tooltip">integral domain<span class="tooltiptext">An integral domain is a ring with no nontrivial <em>zero divisors</em>: \&#40; a \cdot b = 0_R \&#41; implies \&#40; a = 0_R \&#41; or \&#40; b = 0_R \&#41;.</span></span> \(R\) is called irreducible if \(r \neq 0_R\), <span class="tooltip">\(r\) is not a unit<span class="tooltiptext">\&#40; \forall a \in R, a \cdot r \neq 1_R \&#41;</span></span>, and if \(r = xy\) then either \(x\) or \(y\) is a unit.</p>
<p>Similarly, an element \(r\) is called prime if \(r \neq 0_R\), \(r\) is not a unit, and if <span class="tooltip">\(r \mid xy\)<span class="tooltiptext">In a ring, an element \&#40;d\&#41; <em>divides</em> an element \&#40;a\&#41;, written \&#40;d \mid a\&#41;, if there exists some element \&#40;r \in R\&#41; such that \&#40;d \cdot r = a\&#41;.</span></span> then either \(r \mid x\) <span class="tooltip">or<span class="tooltiptext">Not exclusive!</span></span> \(r \mid y\).</p>
<p>In the ring of integers \(\mathbb{Z}\), the primes are in fact exactly the irreducibles. This is not generally true, as we will see in the main example. However, we do have:</p>
<p><h3 id="primes-are-always-irreduci">Primes Are Always Irreducible</h3>
<ol>
<li>Suppose \(r \in R\) is a prime, and \(r = a \cdot b\) for two non-unit elements \(a\) and \(b\).</li>
<li>Since \(r = 1_R \cdot r\), we have \(r \mid r = a \cdot b\). Then, as \(r\) is prime, \(r \mid a\) or \(r \mid b\).</li>
<li><span class="tooltip">Without loss of generality<span class="tooltiptext">We're only considering commutative rings here.</span></span>, suppose \(r \mid a\), ie. \(r \cdot d = a\) for some \(d \in R\).</li>
<li>Then, \(r = a \cdot b = (r \cdot d) \cdot b = r \cdot (d \cdot b)\).</li>
<li>Then, as we are in an integral domain, \(d \cdot b = 1_R\), which means \(b\) is a unit.</li>
<li>Thus \(r\) is irreducible.</li>
</ol></p>
<p><h3 id="but-not-vice-ve">But Not Vice Versa</h3>
Now, we look at the ring \(R = \mathbb{Z}[\sqrt{-5}] = \{a + b \sqrt{-5} : a, b \in \mathbb{Z}\} \leq \mathbb{C}\). As this is a subring of a <span class="tooltip">field<span class="tooltiptext">A field is a ring in which every nonzero element is a unit. \&#40;\mathbb{C}\&#41; is a field, as every element has an inverse.</span></span>, it is an integral domain.</p>
<p>Consider the <em>norm</em> function given by
\[N: R \to \mathbb{N}_0, a + b \sqrt{-5} \mapsto a^2 + 5b^2.\]
Note that this maps \(z \in \mathbb{C}\) to \(|z|^2\), and satisfies \(N(z \cdot w) = N(z) \cdot N(w)\).</p>
<p>This is a really useful property! If \(r \cdot s = 1\), then
\[N(r \cdot s) = N(r) \cdot N(s) = N(1) = 1 \implies N(r) = N(s) = 1.\]
So any unit \(a + b \sqrt{-5}\) has to satisfy \(N(a + b \sqrt{-5}) = a^2 + 5b^2 = 1 \implies a = \pm 1, b = 0\).</p>
<p>Thus the only <em>possible</em> units are \(1\) and \(-1\), which are <span class="tooltip">obviously<span class="tooltiptext">\&#40; 1 \cdot 1 = -1 \cdot -1 = 1 \&#41;</span></span> both units, so they are precisely the two units of \(R\).</p>
<p>Note that there are clearly no elements of norm \(2\) or \(3\): any such element \(r\) would be nonzero and require
\[5b^2 \leq N(r) < 5 \implies b < 1 \implies b = 0, \quad \text{and} \quad N(r) < 4 \implies |a| < 2 \implies a = \pm 1 \]
but then these are just the units again, so there are no such elements.</p>
<p>With this in mind, we claim that \(2 \in R\) is irreducible. Suppose \(2 = a \cdot b\). Then
\[N(a) \cdot N(b) = N(2) = 4 \implies N(a) = 1, \; N(b) = 4 \quad \text{ (in some order).}\]
Thus \(a\) or \(b\) has norm \(1\) and so is a unit, hence \(2\) is irreducible as required.</p>
<p>In the same way, we can demonstrate that the elements \(3, 1 + \sqrt{-5},\) and \(1 - \sqrt{-5}\) are irreducible too.</p>
<p>Importantly, \(2\) does not divide either of \(1 \pm \sqrt{-5}\). Suppose \(2 \cdot r = 1 \pm \sqrt{-5}\). Then we would have \(4 \cdot N(r) = 6 \implies N(r) = 1.5\), which is <span class="tooltip">obviously<span class="tooltiptext">Remember that the norm function \&#40; N \&#41; was a function to \&#40; \mathbb{N}_0 \&#41;: this value is not even part of the codomain.</span></span> not possible.</p>
<p>Now, note that
\[ (1 + \sqrt{-5}) \cdot (1 - \sqrt{-5}) = 6 = 2 \cdot 3 \]
So \(2 \mid 6 = (1 + \sqrt{-5}) \cdot (1 - \sqrt{-5}) \), but neither \(2 \mid (1 + \sqrt{-5})\) nor \(2 \mid (1 - \sqrt{-5})\). Thus by definition, \(2\) cannot be prime in \(R\).</p>
<p>So in general, irreducible elements in integral domains are <em>not</em> necessarily prime.</p>
<p>(Also, factorisation of ring elements into irreducibles is <em>not</em> necessarily unique. The rings in which this property holds are called <em>Euclidean domains</em>.)</p>
