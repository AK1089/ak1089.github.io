<p><h4 id="puzzle">Puzzle</p></h4>
<p>You are on a train with some finite but unknown number of identical carriages. Each carriage has a light, which is either on or off, and a switch, which allows you to toggle the state of the lights. At the start, all the lights are in some <span class="tooltip">random<span class="tooltiptext">This arrangement could be anything, including an adversarial one: your solution shouldn't rely on its behaviour.</span></span> configuration.</p>
<p>You may explore the train and use the switches freely, but you cannot make any other marks. How do you determine <em>with certainty</em> the total number of carriages in the train?</p>
<p><div class="image-container"><img src="summary.png" alt="A diagram explaining your situation. The start carriage is highlighted, but in reality it looks no different from any other carriage."><div class="caption">A diagram explaining your situation. The start carriage is highlighted, but in reality it looks no different from any other carriage.</div></div></p>
<p><h4 id="hints">Hints</p></h4>
<p>Don't hover over these until you've given the problem a go yourself!</p>
<p>Hint 1: <span class="spoiler">You need to find a way of recognising when you've been in the same carriage twice on different laps of the train.</span></p>
<p>Hint 2: <span class="spoiler">You can't know the number for sure unless you go <em>backwards</em> as well as forwards around the train.</span></p>
<p>Hint 3: <span class="spoiler">How do you know there's more than one carriage? How do you know there are more than two?</span></p>
<p>Hint 4: <span class="spoiler">If you change the light in one carriage, and it changes the light in the carriage 5 doors down...</span></p>
