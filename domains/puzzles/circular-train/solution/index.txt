## The Circular Train - Solution

Denote by `0` the start carriage, denote by `k` the carriage you get to by walking k steps forwards from the start, and denote by `-k` the carriage you get to by walking k steps backwards from the start. This numbering is not unique: if in fact there are five carriages in total, then `-3`, `2`, and `7` all refer to the same carriage.

The idea of this solution is to rule out progressively larger numbers of total carriages.

Suppose we conjecture that there are `n` total carriages. What can we do to test this hypothesis?

Well, right now you're in `0`. Switch the light in `0` *on*, and move to `n`.

If the light is off in `n`, then that means `0` and `n` are not the same carriage (as `0` had lights on while `n` has lights off), and so our conjecture was false. Otherwise, if the light is on in `n`, then switch it *off*, and move back to `0` by going backwards.

If the light is still on in `0`, then that means `0` and `n` are not the same carriage (as `0` has lights on while `n` had lights off), and so our conjecture was false. However, if the light is now *off*, then turning the light off in `n` automatically turned it off in `0`! This means that `0` and `n` must be the same carriage, so the total number of carriages must be a factor of `n`.

If we have previously tested and disconfirmed all such conjectures up to `n` (that is: we know there aren't exactly `k` carriages for all `k = 1 ... n`), then we know there are *exactly* `n` total carriages.

So we can proceed by induction: first rule out `1` in this fashion, then `2`, then `3`, and so on. At some point, you try to rule out the correct number and fail, and here you know with certainty that you have the correct number of carriages!
