The one redeeming thing about the [tragedy of 2016](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_United_Kingdom_European_Union_membership_referendum) is that I don't have to follow [GDPR](https://gdpr-info.eu/). However, if you really want to disable them, here's a toggle:

<slider-off cookies-slider> Allow Cookies?

(Note: technically, turning this slider off does in fact set a cookie, which is called `cookiePermissions` and is set to `"cookiesDisabled"`. This is essential, for obvious reasons. Turning this setting off breaks a few parts of the website, most notably the [site map](../../map).)
