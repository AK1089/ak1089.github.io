## Minecraft Resource Pack Hosting

This page is intended as a start-to-finish guide for hosting a Minecraft [resource pack](!Resource packs in Minecraft allow you to control the visuals, sounds, and other aesthetics for the game in a lot of detail). Each section is self-contained: if a step doesn't apply to you, or you don't need help with it, feel free to skip any of them.

We'll be using [GitHub](https://github.com) to host our pack. If you don't yet have an account, sign up [here](https://github.com/signup).
