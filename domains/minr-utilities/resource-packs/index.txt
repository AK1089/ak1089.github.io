## Minecraft Resource Pack Hosting

This page is intended as a start-to-finish guide for hosting a Minecraft [resource pack](!Resource packs in Minecraft allow you to control the visuals, sounds, and other aesthetics for the game in a lot of detail). Each section is self-contained: if a step doesn't apply to you, or you don't need help with it, feel free to skip any of them.

We'll be using [GitHub](https://github.com) to host our pack. If you don't yet have an account, sign up [here](https://github.com/signup).

### Understanding the Folder Structure

A Minecraft Resource Pack is essentially a folder which holds a lot of files with your custom textures and resources in them. The below file tree shows how this folder is organised. Hover over each item to see more detail.

(This is originally based on the [wiki](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Resource_pack#Folder_structure)'s version. I have simplified it to omit some paths which are more complex or less relevant for server resource packs.)

```tree
[resource pack name]
- pack.mcmeta
- pack.png
- assets
  - minecraft
    - font
        - your-font
    - sounds.json
    - sounds
        - [sound].ogg
    - textures
        - block
            - [texture].png
        - entity
            - [texture].png
            - [entity type]
              - [texture].png
        - item
            - [texture].png
        - painting
            - [texture].png
```

We'll go over each of these in more detail individually later on.
