## Utilities for Minr

I often make or contribute to tools and guides for Zero.Minr.Org, particularly for
[mapmakers](!Minr is a challenge map server, where players of a sufficiently high rank can submit their own puzzles, parkour maps, mazes, and more.)
and [scripters](!Minr runs a custom plugin called Minr Script Code, or MSC, which allows players to write code for use in their maps.).
Here are some useful ones:

<ol>
- [AK's Custom Minr Mapmaking Tool](https://minr-map-art-814d7355b513.herokuapp.com/), a tool for importing reference images directly into the game as map artwork
- [Lightwood13's MSC VSCode Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Lightwood13.msc), a VSCode Marketplace extension to which I have contributed a fair bit
- [My MSC Tips Series](../minr-script-help), a series of writeups about different aspects of MSC
