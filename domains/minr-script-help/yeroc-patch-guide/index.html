<p>TL;DR: look at the example script and basically copy paste the important lines into your own script.</p>
<p>Sometimes in scripts for maps, you want to teleport the player, or give them items, or set variables which allow them to progress further. Sometimes, this happens after a delay: commonly, a back-and-forth dialogue script concludes with the player being teleported away to a new room.</p>
<p>However, this enables an exploit, usually known as a "yeroc%" run (after Mouthwest, formerly known as Yeroc424, who popularised it). During the execution of a dialogue script, the player can <code class="inline-code">/kill</code> to reset their timer, and when the script concludes they will be teleported, essentially beginning halfway through the map with a zero second timer.</p>
<p>While this is against the rules, it's usually good for mapmakers to guard against this anyway. I thought I'd make it even easier, with a namespace appropriately named <code class="inline-code">yerocpatch</code>. Here's how to use it in your scripts:</p>
<p>
        <pre style="position: relative;">
            <button class="copy-button" onclick="copyToClipboard(this)">Copy</button>
            <code data-language="msc" class="line-numbers"><span>&#35; put this at the start of your script, just below things like cooldowns</span>
<span>@define Int yeroc_check = yerocpatch::setup(player)</span>
<span> </span>
<span>&#35; most of your script goes here, for example some dialogue</span>
<span>@player NPC: Hi! I'm a placeholder person created for demonstration purposes.</span>
<span>@delay 80</span>
<span>@player NPC: And that was a four second delay during which you could have reset your timer!</span>
<span> </span>
<span>&#35; add this section before you do anything with the player: it checks if the player's run is still valid</span>
<span>@var yeroc_check = yerocpatch::verify(player, yeroc_check, "default")</span>
<span> </span>
<span>&#35; terminates the script if the run is invalid (verification codes 0, 1, 2, 3), so the teleport doesn't run</span>
<span>@if yeroc_check < 4</span>
<span>    @return</span>
<span>@fi</span>
<span> </span>
<span>&#35; do the possibly skip-enabling thing like a teleport</span>
<span>@bypass /execute in minecraft:theta run teleport @s 1234 56 789</span>
</code>
        </pre></p>
<p>Some notes on drawbacks and more advanced usage:
<ol>
<li>At any point in your script before verification, you can use the line <code class="inline-code">@var yerocpatch::invalidate(player, yeroc_check)</code> to make sure the verification fails. This is useful in conditional branches, to terminate scripts (eg. if the player walks back into an area they shouldn't, even if this doesn't reset their timer).</li>
<li>You may also use <code class="inline-code">@var yerocpatch::terminate(player, "your-map-code-here")</code> in any <em>other</em> script to invalidate <em>every</em> ongoing check in your map.</li>
<li>In the verification stage, you may replace "default" with any string. The flags inside will determine the verification behaviour.</li>
<ul>
<li>Strings containing "nullify" will nullify the player's timer, so that they can complete the map but not attain a time. </li>
<li>Strings containing "invalidate" will invalidate the player's completion altogether.</li>
<li>Strings containing "kill" will kill the player and reset them to their checkpoint.</li>
</ul>
<li>The namespace will only work on maps which have timers attached: this does not generally include maps on Board. It will <em>not</em> throw errors if you use the scripts, but simply not invalidate timers or kill players. If you want to test the behaviour of your scripts, ask an admin to move your map to Valley.</li>
<li>Everything has guards and checks in place, so you don't have to worry about messing up players if they join another map mid-execution.</li>
</ol></p>
<p>You may also notice a reference to verification code <code class="inline-code">4</code> in the conditional statement. The full list is as follows:
<ul>
<li>code <strong>6</strong> is returned when the checker you have referenced is not found, indicating an error in how you have set this up.</li>
<li>code <strong>5</strong> is returned when the checker has no timer attached, which is what happens when the map is on Board.</li>
<li>code <strong>4</strong> is returned when the player has done everything right and the check is valid.</li>
<li>code <strong>3</strong> is returned when the player has left the map since the script started running.</li>
<li>code <strong>2</strong> is returned when the player's timer is already invalidated.</li>
<li>code <strong>1</strong> is returned when the player has reset their timer since the script started running.</li>
<li>code <strong>0</strong> is returned when the checker has been manually invalidated using <code class="inline-code">yerocpatch::terminate</code> or <code class="inline-code">yerocpatch::invalidate</code>.</li>
</ul></p>
