## Let's Build a Selector-To-UUID Converter

You're probably familiar with UUIDs in Minecraft. They're the weird strings of numbers and letters that everyone seems to have associated with their username - you might have seen them on [NameMC](https://namemc.com/), for example. Mine is `e62bfa1e-f625-4ad3-9403-7e7f8e14d0f1`. In today's article, we're going to explore what these mean and why they're useful, and build a useful function which allows you to get them for arbitrary entities.

## What is a UUID?

A UUID, short for *__U__niversally __U__nique __ID__entifier*, is a 32-character long [hexadecimal](https://byjus.com/maths/hexadecimal-number-system/) number with dashes to separate it into blocks of `8-4-4-4-12`. Hexadecimal is a number system with 16 digits (hexa = 6, deci = 10), which are 0-9 then A-F. For example, the number `23` in hexadecimal represents what we would think of as 35, since 35 = 2 × 16 + 3 × 1.

The "point" of UUIDs is that they really are unique, and you can (almost) guarantee this *without having to put in effort into ensuring it manually*. Why? Well, let's understand the structure of UUIDs to find out.

```uuid-v4.1
xxxxxxxx-xxxx-4xxx-yxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx
```

The `4` in position 13 represents the version of the UUID (since Minecraft uses version 4). The `y` in position 17 represents the variant: Minecraft uses variant 4.1, so [this digit can be `8`, `9`, `a`, or `b`](!The two most significant bits of the nibble corresponding to the 17th hexadecimal digit are set to 10, leaving the possible values as these four: 1000, 1001, 1010, 1011.). This specification is described in [Section 4.4 of the IETF's RFC4122 document](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc4122#section-4.4) from 2005.

**Every single other part of the UUID is generated completely at random.**

Why is this unique? Well, probability!

The 13th digit is always 4. The 17th digit can be any of 4 possibilities. The 30 other digits each have 16 possibilities. This means the number of total possible UUIDs is \( 4 \times 16^{30} = 2^{122} = 5,316,911,983,139,663,491,615,228,241,121,378,304 \), or over 5 billion billion billion billion. This is a mindblowingly large number. To put it in perspective, if you generated one UUID every second *since the dawn of the universe*, there would be an [over 98% chance](!\&#40; \mathbb{P}&#40;\text{collision}&#41; \approx 1 - e^{-t^2/2n} \\ = 1 - e^{-1.89 \cdot 10^{35} / 2^{123}} \approx 0.0176 \&#41;) that they were *all* unique!

That's pretty useful! We can generate these things pretty easily and cheaply, and have a guarantee that they're unique, so we can use them as our internal references for things without worrying that something will break because we've given two things the same name.

## How does Minecraft use UUIDs?

Minecraft does this with every entity. This means every single entity (including players) has one of these unique codes. We often have to reference these UUIDs, for example when running pretty much every command targeting an entity, or when constructing an `Entity` object in MSC.

Sometimes we want the UUIDs of an entity.
