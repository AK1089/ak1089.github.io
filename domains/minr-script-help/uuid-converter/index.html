<h2 id="let-s-build-a-selector-to-entity-converter-or-all-about-uuids">Let's Build a Selector-To-Entity Converter (or, All About UUIDs)</p></h2>
<p>You're probably familiar with UUIDs in Minecraft. They're the weird strings of numbers and letters that everyone seems to have associated with their username - you might have seen them on <a href="https://namemc.com/">NameMC</a>, for example. Mine is <code class="inline-code">e62bfa1e-f625-4ad3-9403-7e7f8e14d0f1</code>. In today's article, we're going to explore what these mean and why they're useful, and build a useful function which allows you to get them for arbitrary entities.</p>

</ul></div></p>
<p><h2 id="what-is-a-uuid">What is a UUID?</p></h2>
<p>A UUID, short for <em><u>U</u>niversally <u>U</u>nique <u>ID</u>entifier</em>, is a 32-character long <a href="https://byjus.com/maths/hexadecimal-number-system/">hexadecimal</a> number with dashes to separate it into blocks of <code class="inline-code">8-4-4-4-12</code>. Hexadecimal is a number system with 16 digits (hexa = 6, deci = 10), which are 0-9 then A-F. For example, the number <code class="inline-code">23</code> in hexadecimal represents what we would think of as 35, since 35 = 2 × 16 + 3 × 1.</p>
<p>The "point" of UUIDs is that they really are unique, and you can (almost) guarantee this <em>without having to put in effort into ensuring it manually</em>. Why? Well, let's understand the structure of UUIDs to find out.</p>
<p>
        <pre style="position: relative;">
            <button class="copy-button" onclick="copyToClipboard(this)">Copy</button>
            <code data-language="uuid-v4.1" class="line-numbers"><span>xxxxxxxx-xxxx-4xxx-yxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx</span>
</code>
        </pre></p>
<p>The <code class="inline-code">4</code> in position 13 represents the version of the UUID (since Minecraft uses version 4). The <code class="inline-code">y</code> in position 17 represents the variant: Minecraft uses variant 4.1, so <span class="tooltip">this digit can be <code class="inline-code">8</code>, <code class="inline-code">9</code>, <code class="inline-code">a</code>, or <code class="inline-code">b</code><span class="tooltiptext">The two most significant bits of the nibble corresponding to the 17th hexadecimal digit are set to 10, leaving the possible values as these four: 1000, 1001, 1010, 1011.</span></span>. This specification is described in <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc4122#section-4.4">Section 4.4 of the IETF's RFC4122 document</a> from 2005.</p>
<p><strong>Every single other part of the UUID is generated completely at random.</strong></p>
<p>Why is this unique? Well, probability!</p>
<p>The 13th digit is always 4. The 17th digit can be any of 4 possibilities. The 30 other digits each have 16 possibilities. This means the number of total possible UUIDs is \( 4 \times 16^{30} = 2^{122} = 5,316,911,983,139,663,491,615,228,241,121,378,304 \), or over 5 billion billion billion billion. This is a mindblowingly large number. To put it in perspective, if you generated one UUID every second <em>since the dawn of the universe</em>, there would be an <span class="tooltip">over 98% chance<span class="tooltiptext">\&#40; \mathbb{P}&#40;\text{collision}&#41; \approx 1 - e^{-t^2/2n} \\ = 1 - e^{-1.89 \cdot 10^{35} / 2^{123}} \approx 0.0176 \&#41;</span></span> that they were <em>all</em> unique!</p>
<p>That's pretty useful! We can generate these things pretty easily and cheaply, and have a guarantee that they're unique, so we can use them as our internal references for things without worrying that something will break because we've given two things the same name.</p>
<p><h2 id="how-does-minecraft-use-uuids">How does Minecraft use UUIDs?</p></h2>
<p>Minecraft does this with every entity. This means every single entity (including players) has one of these unique codes. We often have to reference these UUIDs, for example when running pretty much every command targeting an entity, or when constructing an <code class="inline-code">Entity</code> object in MSC.</p>
<p>Sometimes we want the UUID of an entity. Let's see where it's displayed in <code class="inline-code">/data get entity</code>, tried on a minecart which I know to have a UUID of <code class="inline-code">11ac0982-00e1-4f5e-a8dc-c96258766524</code>.</p>
<p><div class="image-container"><img src="minecart.png" alt="What you see when looking at the data of an entity (here, the minecart)"><div class="caption">What you see when looking at the data of an entity (here, the minecart)</div></div></p>
<p>That's weird. It says <code class="inline-code">UUID: [I; 296487298, 14765918, -1461925534, 1484154148]</code>. That doesn't look like the format we're expecting at all!</p>
<p>However, <span class="tooltip">let's do some digging<span class="tooltiptext">Okay, I do know why this happens. However, I think it's more interesting to show the process of figuring it out!</span></span>. Here's a converter which swaps numbers back and forth between decimal and hexadecimal. (Try it yourself - you can edit the numbers on either side!)</p>
<p><label for="decimal">Decimal:</label>
<input type="text" id="decimal" oninput="convertDecToHex()" value="296487298">
<span>&#8596;</span>
<label for="hexadecimal">Hexadecimal:</label>
<input type="text" id="hexadecimal" oninput="convertHexToDec()" value="11ac0982"></p>
<p>That's interesting. <code class="inline-code">296487298</code> in decimal (the first number of the list) is <code class="inline-code">11ac0982</code> in hexadecimal (the first 8 characters of the string UUID). This obviously isn't a coincidence. The reason for this is that Minecraft stores UUIDs in a weird format which uses four 32-bit signed integers.</p>
<p>A 32-bit integer is an integer which is stored using 32 binary digits, or "bits". "Signed" means the first bit is used to denote the <em>sign</em> of a number: whether it's positive or negative. Let's convert the hexadecimal <code class="inline-code">11ac0982</code> to binary.</p>
<p>
        <pre style="position: relative;">
            <button class="copy-button" onclick="copyToClipboard(this)">Copy</button>
            <code data-language="hexadecimal-binary" class="line-numbers"><span>     1    1    a    c    0    9    8    2</span>
<span>= 0001 0001 1010 1100 0000 1001 1000 0010</span>
</code>
        </pre></p>
<p><code class="inline-code">00010001101011000000100110000010</code> in binary is exactly <code class="inline-code">296487298</code>. You can see how each <span class="tooltip">4 bits<span class="tooltiptext">Also known as a nibble. \&#40; 2^4 = 16 \&#41;, hence there being 4 bits: each hexadecimal digit contains \&#40; \mathrm{log}_2 &#40; 16 &#41; = 4 \&#41; times as much information as a bit.</span></span> correspond to each hexadecimal character, too.</p>
<p>However, you might notice something weird. If you put the third number, <code class="inline-code">-1461925534</code>, into the converter on the decimal side, you'll notice that it doesn't match up at all with the third octet of hexadecimal digits. We should get <code class="inline-code">a8dcc962</code>, but we get a negative number.</p>
<p>Okay, what number <em>would have</em> given us the correct answer? Sticking <code class="inline-code">a8dcc962</code> into the hexadecimal side of the converter, we get <code class="inline-code">2833041762</code>. <span class="tooltip">On a whim<span class="tooltiptext">Not really on a whim. There's obviously a reason this works, and we'll see it shortly.</span></span>, let's calculate \( 2833041762 + 1461925534 = 4294967296 = 2^{32} \). So the number we wanted is exactly \( 2^{32} \) away from the number we have. This is interesting, because we're dealing with 32-bit numbers! In fact, that's exactly why this works. Let's see how <code class="inline-code">a8dcc962</code> is stored in binary.</p>
<p>
        <pre style="position: relative;">
            <button class="copy-button" onclick="copyToClipboard(this)">Copy</button>
            <code data-language="hexadecimal-binary" class="line-numbers"><span>     a    8    d    c    c    9    6    2</span>
<span>= 1010 1000 1101 1100 1100 1001 0110 0010</span>
</code>
        </pre></p>
<p>But now let's take <code class="inline-code">10101000110111001100100101100010</code> and represent it as a 32-bit signed integer. Since the first bit is a <code class="inline-code">1</code>, this number is negative. These numbers are written in <a href="https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~tomf/notes/cps104/twoscomp.html">two's complement notation</a>, which is <span class="tooltip">a bit too advanced to go into here<span class="tooltiptext">The rundown is that to convert a negative binary number to decimal, you strip the leading 1, invert the remaining 31 bits, convert that number to decimal - treating it as a positive number - and then add 1. Then, you negate it to get a negative.</span></span>, but suffice it to say that</p>
<p>
        <pre style="position: relative;">
            <button class="copy-button" onclick="copyToClipboard(this)">Copy</button>
            <code data-language="binary-decimal" class="line-numbers"><span>  1 0101000110111001100100101100010</span>
<span>= -                      1461925534</span>
</code>
        </pre></p>
<p>Fantastic! This means we know how our numbers are stored. We'll keep this in mind for when we're writing our code.</p>
<p><h2 id="what-are-we-building-and-why">What are we building and why?</p></h2>
<p><span class="tooltip">A lot of the time<span class="tooltiptext">Well. Maybe for some people.</span></span>, you'll be writing scripts which deal with entities. This is all well and good if you have an <code class="inline-code">Entity</code> object already, or if you just want to use default Minecraft commands. For example,</p>
<p>
        <pre style="position: relative;">
            <button class="copy-button" onclick="copyToClipboard(this)">Copy</button>
            <code data-language="msc" class="line-numbers"><span>@bypass /minecraft:kill @e[type=pig,distance=..5,sort=nearest,limit=1]</span>
</code>
        </pre></p>
<p>kills the nearest pig to the player if it's within 5 blocks, and</p>
<p>
        <pre style="position: relative;">
            <button class="copy-button" onclick="copyToClipboard(this)">Copy</button>
            <code data-language="msc" class="line-numbers"><span>@var some_namespace::clickedEntityHealth = entity.getHealth()</span>
</code>
        </pre></p>
<p>(<span class="tooltip">if applied as an entity script<span class="tooltiptext">This is so the entity variable is defined, which it is by default in an entity script - in fact it is the entity the script is bound to.</span></span>) sets the variable <code class="inline-code">Int some_namespace::clickedEntityHealth</code> to the health of the entity the script is on.</p>
<p>But this doesn't cover every use-case! Sometimes you want to select entities, and do things to them that you can do in MSC. There's no standard way to do this - you can only select entities using <code class="inline-code">@e[...]</code> if you're using Minecraft command selectors, and you can't run MSC things on them.</p>
<p>What if there was a way to turn <code class="inline-code">@e[type=pig,distance=..5,sort=nearest,limit=1]</code> into <code class="inline-code">27f6a0b7-db1c-4bfa-ac43-148a88b53c3d</code> (or whatever the UUID of the pig really is?)
 
Well, let's make one!</p>
<p><h2 id="creating-a-selector-to-entity-converter-in-msc">Creating a selector-to-Entity converter in MSC</p></h2>
<p>Okay, here's what we want our function to be able to do. Say we have a pig that's somewhere in the 20x20x20 cube centred at (123, 45, 678). There are a bunch of pigs there, but we specifically want one we've given the tag <code class="inline-code">piggy</code> to. We want to use it as an <code class="inline-code">Entity</code>, say to <span class="tooltip">eject all its passengers<span class="tooltiptext">This is just a random example. Entity objects are pretty useful and this is just one of the methods on them.</span></span>. This means we need a function which takes entity selectors (<code class="inline-code">@e[...]</code>) and returns <code class="inline-code">Entity</code> objects.</p>
<p><ol>
<li>We pass in a string like <code class="inline-code">type=pig,x=113,dx=20,y=35,dy=20,z=668</code>, and the world we want to search in (say <code class="inline-code">Theta</code>).</li>
<li>It returns an <code class="inline-code">Entity</code> object which corresponds to our pig.</li>
</ol></p>
<p>Let's write this piece by piece.</p>
