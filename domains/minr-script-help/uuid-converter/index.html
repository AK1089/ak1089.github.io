<p>You're probably familiar with UUIDs in Minecraft. They're the weird strings of numbers and letters that everyone seems to have associated with their username - you might have seen them on <a href="https://namemc.com/">NameMC</a>, for example. Mine is <code class="inline-code">e62bfa1e-f625-4ad3-9403-7e7f8e14d0f1</code>. In today's article, we're going to explore what these mean and why they're useful, and build a useful function which allows you to get them for arbitrary entities.</p>

<p><h3 id="what-is-a-uuid">What is a UUID?</p></h3>
<p>A UUID, short for <em><u>U</u>niversally <u>U</u>nique <u>ID</u>entifier</em>, is a 32-character long <a href="https://byjus.com/maths/hexadecimal-number-system/">hexadecimal</a> number with dashes to separate it into blocks of <code class="inline-code">8-4-4-4-12</code>. Hexadecimal is a number system with 16 digits (hexa = 6, deci = 10), which are 0-9 then A-F. For example, the number <code class="inline-code">23</code> in hexadecimal represents what we would think of as 35, since 35 = 2 × 16 + 3 × 1.</p>
<p>The "point" of UUIDs is that they really are unique, and you can (almost) guarantee this <em>without having to put in effort into ensuring it manually</em>. Why? Well, let's understand the structure of UUIDs to find out.</p>
<p>
        <pre style="position: relative;">
            <button class="copy-button" onclick="copyToClipboard(this)">Copy</button>
            <code data-language="uuid-v4.1" class="line-numbers"><span>xxxxxxxx-xxxx-4xxx-yxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx</span>
</code>
        </pre></p>
<p>The <code class="inline-code">4</code> in position 13 represents the version of the UUID (since Minecraft uses version 4). The <code class="inline-code">y</code> in position 17 represents the variant: Minecraft uses variant 4.1, so <span class="tooltip">this digit can be <code class="inline-code">8</code>, <code class="inline-code">9</code>, <code class="inline-code">a</code>, or <code class="inline-code">b</code><span class="tooltiptext">The two most significant bits of the nibble corresponding to the 17th hexadecimal digit are set to 10, leaving the possible values as these four: 1000, 1001, 1010, 1011.</span></span>. This specification is described in <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc4122#section-4.4">Section 4.4 of the IETF's RFC4122 document</a> from <span class="tooltip">2005<span class="tooltiptext">I am <em>just</em> older than the Version 4 UUID, which is shocking to me.</span></span>.</p>
<p><strong>Every single other part of the UUID is generated completely at random.</strong></p>
<p>Why is this unique? Well, probability!</p>
<p>The 13th digit is always 4. The 17th digit can be any of 4 possibilities. The 30 other digits each have 16 possibilities. This means the number of total possible UUIDs is \( 4 \times 16^{30} = 2^{122} = 5,316,911,983,139,663,491,615,228,241,121,378,304 \), or over 5 billion billion billion billion. This is a mindblowingly large number. To put it in perspective, if you generated one UUID every second <em>since the dawn of the universe</em>, there would be an <span class="tooltip">over 98% chance<span class="tooltiptext">\&#40; \mathbb{P}&#40;\text{collision}&#41; \approx 1 - e^{-t^2/2n} \\ = 1 - e^{-1.89 \cdot 10^{35} / 2^{123}} \approx 0.0176 \&#41;</span></span> that they were <em>all</em> unique!</p>
<p>That's pretty useful! We can generate these things pretty easily and cheaply, and have a guarantee that they're unique, so we can use them as our internal references for things without worrying that something will break because we've given two things the same name.</p>
<p><h3 id="how-does-minecraft-use-uuids">How does Minecraft use UUIDs?</p></h3>
<p>Minecraft does this with every entity. This means every single entity (including players) has one of these unique codes. We often have to reference these UUIDs, for example when running pretty much every command targeting an entity, or when constructing an <code class="inline-code">Entity</code> object in MSC.</p>
<p>Sometimes we want the UUID of an entity. Let's see where it's displayed in <code class="inline-code">/data get entity</code>, tried on a minecart which I know to have a UUID of <code class="inline-code">11ac0982-00e1-4f5e-a8dc-c96258766524</code>.</p>
<p><div class="image-container"><img src="minecart.png" alt="What you see when looking at the data of an entity (here, the minecart)"><div class="caption">What you see when looking at the data of an entity (here, the minecart)</div></div></p>
<p>That's weird. It says <code class="inline-code">UUID: [I; 296487298, 14765918, -1461925534, 1484154148]</code>. That doesn't look like the format we're expecting at all!</p>
<p>However, <span class="tooltip">let's do some digging<span class="tooltiptext">Okay, I do know why this happens. However, I think it's more interesting to show the process of figuring it out!</span></span>. Here's a converter which swaps numbers back and forth between decimal and hexadecimal. (Try it yourself - you can edit the numbers on either side!)</p>
<p><label for="decimal">Decimal:</label>
<input type="text" id="decimal" oninput="convertDecToHex()" value="296487298">
<span>&#8596;</span>
<label for="hexadecimal">Hexadecimal:</label>
<input type="text" id="hexadecimal" oninput="convertHexToDec()" value="11ac0982"></p>
<p>That's interesting. <code class="inline-code">296487298</code> in decimal (the first number of the list) is <code class="inline-code">11ac0982</code> in hexadecimal (the first 8 characters of the string UUID). This obviously isn't a coincidence. The reason for this is that Minecraft stores UUIDs in a weird format which uses four 32-bit signed integers.</p>
<p>A 32-bit integer is an integer which is stored using 32 binary digits, or "bits". "Signed" means the first bit is used to denote the <em>sign</em> of a number: whether it's positive or negative. Let's convert the hexadecimal <code class="inline-code">11ac0982</code> to binary.</p>
<p>
        <pre style="position: relative;">
            <button class="copy-button" onclick="copyToClipboard(this)">Copy</button>
            <code data-language="hexadecimal-binary" class="line-numbers"><span>     1    1    a    c    0    9    8    2</span>
<span>= 0001 0001 1010 1100 0000 1001 1000 0010</span>
</code>
        </pre></p>
<p><code class="inline-code">00010001101011000000100110000010</code> in binary is exactly <code class="inline-code">296487298</code>. You can see how each <span class="tooltip">4 bits<span class="tooltiptext">Also known as a nibble. \&#40; 2^4 = 16 \&#41;, hence there being 4 bits: each hexadecimal digit contains \&#40; \mathrm{log}_2 &#40; 16 &#41; = 4 \&#41; times as much information as a bit.</span></span> correspond to each hexadecimal character, too.</p>
<p>However, you might notice something weird. If you put the third number, <code class="inline-code">-1461925534</code>, into the converter on the decimal side, you'll notice that it doesn't match up at all with the third octet of hexadecimal digits. We should get <code class="inline-code">a8dcc962</code>, but we get a negative number.</p>
<p>Okay, what number <em>would have</em> given us the correct answer? Sticking <code class="inline-code">a8dcc962</code> into the hexadecimal side of the converter, we get <code class="inline-code">2833041762</code>. <span class="tooltip">On a whim<span class="tooltiptext">Not really on a whim. There's obviously a reason this works, and we'll see it shortly.</span></span>, let's calculate \( 2833041762 + 1461925534 = 4294967296 = 2^{32} \). So the number we wanted is exactly \( 2^{32} \) away from the number we have. This is interesting, because we're dealing with 32-bit numbers! In fact, that's exactly why this works. Let's see how <code class="inline-code">a8dcc962</code> is stored in binary.</p>
<p>
        <pre style="position: relative;">
            <button class="copy-button" onclick="copyToClipboard(this)">Copy</button>
            <code data-language="hexadecimal-binary" class="line-numbers"><span>     a    8    d    c    c    9    6    2</span>
<span>= 1010 1000 1101 1100 1100 1001 0110 0010</span>
</code>
        </pre></p>
<p>But now let's take <code class="inline-code">10101000110111001100100101100010</code> and represent it as a 32-bit signed integer. Since the first bit is a <code class="inline-code">1</code>, this number is negative. These numbers are written in <a href="https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~tomf/notes/cps104/twoscomp.html">two's complement notation</a>, which is <span class="tooltip">a bit too advanced to go into here<span class="tooltiptext">The rundown is that to convert a negative binary number to decimal, you strip the leading 1, invert the remaining 31 bits, convert that number to decimal - treating it as a positive number - and then add 1. Then, you negate it to get a negative.</span></span>, but suffice it to say that</p>
<p>
        <pre style="position: relative;">
            <button class="copy-button" onclick="copyToClipboard(this)">Copy</button>
            <code data-language="binary-decimal" class="line-numbers"><span>  1 0101000110111001100100101100010</span>
<span>= -                      1461925534</span>
</code>
        </pre></p>
<p>Fantastic! This means we know how our numbers are stored. We'll keep this in mind for when we're writing our code.</p>
<p><h3 id="what-are-we-building-and-why">What are we building and why?</p></h3>
<p><span class="tooltip">A lot of the time<span class="tooltiptext">Well. Maybe for some people.</span></span>, you'll be writing scripts which deal with entities. This is all well and good if you have an <code class="inline-code">Entity</code> object already, or if you just want to use default Minecraft commands. For example,</p>
<p>
        <pre style="position: relative;">
            <button class="copy-button" onclick="copyToClipboard(this)">Copy</button>
            <code data-language="msc" class="line-numbers"><span>@bypass /minecraft:kill @e[type=pig,distance=..5,sort=nearest,limit=1]</span>
</code>
        </pre></p>
<p>kills the nearest pig to the player if it's within 5 blocks, and</p>
<p>
        <pre style="position: relative;">
            <button class="copy-button" onclick="copyToClipboard(this)">Copy</button>
            <code data-language="msc" class="line-numbers"><span>@var some_namespace::clickedEntityHealth = entity.getHealth()</span>
</code>
        </pre></p>
<p>(<span class="tooltip">if applied as an entity script<span class="tooltiptext">This is so the entity variable is defined, which it is by default in an entity script - in fact it is the entity the script is bound to.</span></span>) sets the variable <code class="inline-code">Int some_namespace::clickedEntityHealth</code> to the health of the entity the script is on.</p>
<p>But this doesn't cover every use-case! Sometimes you want to select entities, and do things to them that you can do in MSC. There's no standard way to do this - you can only select entities using <code class="inline-code">@e[...]</code> if you're using Minecraft command selectors, and you can't run MSC things on them.</p>
<p>What if there was a way to turn <code class="inline-code">@e[type=pig,distance=..5,sort=nearest,limit=1]</code> into <code class="inline-code">27f6a0b7-db1c-4bfa-ac43-148a88b53c3d</code> (or whatever the UUID of the pig really is?)
 
Well, let's make one!</p>
<p><h3 id="creating-a-selector-to-entity-converter-in-msc">Creating a selector-to-Entity converter in MSC</p></h3>
<p>Okay, here's what we want our function to be able to do. Say we have a pig that's somewhere in the 20x20x20 cube centred at (123, 45, 678). We want to use it as an <code class="inline-code">Entity</code>, say to <span class="tooltip">eject all its passengers<span class="tooltiptext">This is just a random example. Entity objects are pretty useful and this is just one of the methods on them.</span></span>. This means we need a function which takes entity selectors (<code class="inline-code">@e[...]</code>) and returns <code class="inline-code">Entity</code> objects.</p>
<p><ol>
<li>We pass in a string like <code class="inline-code">type=pig,x=113,dx=20,y=35,dy=20,z=668</code>, and the world we want to search in (say <code class="inline-code">Theta</code>).</li>
<li>It returns an <code class="inline-code">Entity</code> object which corresponds to our pig.</li>
</ol></p>
<p>
        <pre style="position: relative;">
            <button class="copy-button" onclick="copyToClipboard(this)">Copy</button>
            <code data-language="minecraft" class="line-numbers"><span>/function define aktools Entity selectorToEntity(String selectorString, String world)</span>
</code>
        </pre></p>
<p>This defines the function. (If this line looks confusing to you, see <a href="../functions">last week's writeup on functions</a>). Let's begin writing it.</p>
<p>
        <pre style="position: relative;">
            <button class="copy-button" onclick="copyToClipboard(this)">Copy</button>
            <code data-language="msc" class="line-numbers"><span>&num; Function aktools::selectorToEntity(String selectorString, String world) -> Optional&lt;Entity&gt;</span>
<span> </span>
<span>&num; these are the alphanumeric characters used as digits in hexadecimal</span>
<span>@define String[] hexadecimalDigits = String["0", "1", "2", "3", "4", "5", "6", "7", "8", "9", "a", "b", "c", "d", "e", "f"]</span>
<span> </span>
<span>&num; powers stores the value of 16^n for each n, ie. some basic higher digit value in hexadecimal</span>
<span>@define Long[] powers = [268435456, 16777216, 1048576, 65536, 4096, 256, 16, 1]</span>
<span> </span>
<span>&num; stores the integer UUID being worked with at any given time</span>
<span>&num; this must be a Long, as Int values are capped at 2^31 - 1 = 2,147,483,647 and we deal with larger numbers</span>
<span>@define Long currentUUID</span>
<span> </span>
<span>&num; the characters of the UUID in hexadecimal</span>
<span>@define String[] u = String[]</span>
</code>
        </pre></p>
<p>This should be good setup-wise. We have a function <code class="inline-code">aktools::selectorToUUID</code>. It takes in two strings: <code class="inline-code">selectorString</code> and <code class="inline-code">world</code>, which are the strings we decided on earlier. We also have a few variables we need, which we'll use to work with UUIDs. In the end, <code class="inline-code">u</code> will be a list with the hexadecimal digits of the UUID. Note that <code class="inline-code">powers</code> is the list of powers of 16:</p>
<p>
        <pre style="position: relative;">
            <button class="copy-button" onclick="copyToClipboard(this)">Copy</button>
            <code data-language="powers" class="line-numbers"><span>00000001 (base 16) = 16^0 = 1</span>
<span>00000010 (base 16) = 16^1 = 16</span>
<span>00000100 (base 16) = 16^2 = 256</span>
<span>00001000 (base 16) = 16^3 = 4096</span>
<span>00010000 (base 16) = 16^4 = 65536</span>
<span>00100000 (base 16) = 16^5 = 1048576</span>
<span>01000000 (base 16) = 16^6 = 16777216</span>
<span>10000000 (base 16) = 16^7 = 268435456</span>
</code>
        </pre></p>
<p>Now, let's work with them. We need to get the UUID from the selector. We know from <code class="inline-code">/data get entity</code> earlier that this is stored as a four-part list, so we're going to have to get it with four commands. Let's begin writing this loop:</p>
<p>
        <pre style="position: relative;">
            <button class="copy-button" onclick="copyToClipboard(this)">Copy</button>
            <code data-language="msc" class="line-numbers"><span>&num; UUIDs are stored as four decimal integers - this gets all of them one-by-one</span>
<span>@for Int i in list::range(0, 4)</span>
<span> </span>
<span>    &num; minecraft command to get UUID - must be stored as a Long for further processing</span>
<span>    @var currentUUID = Long(util::executeAndQueryResult("/execute in {{world}} run data get entity @e[{{selectorString}},limit=1] UUID[{{i}}]"))</span>
<span> </span>
<span>    &num; do some processing to convert them into hexadecimal...</span>
<span> </span>
<span>@done</span>
</code>
        </pre></p>
<p>We use <code class="inline-code">util::executeAndQueryResult</code> to steal a number from Minecraft's <code class="inline-code">/data get entity</code> and get it into MSC. The command we're using is</p>
<p>
        <pre style="position: relative;">
            <button class="copy-button" onclick="copyToClipboard(this)">Copy</button>
            <code data-language="minecraft" class="line-numbers"><span>/execute in {{world}} run data get entity @e[{{selectorString}},limit=1] UUID[{{i}}]</span>
</code>
        </pre></p>
<p>which is exactly what we want, for each <span class="tooltip">\(i \in \{ 0, 1, 2, 3 \}\)<span class="tooltiptext">This is what the list::range part does. We want to get the first to fourth number in the list, but as usual in programming the numbering starts from 0, so we want the four indices 0, 1, 2 and 3.</span></span>! It might look like</p>
<p>
        <pre style="position: relative;">
            <button class="copy-button" onclick="copyToClipboard(this)">Copy</button>
            <code data-language="minecraft" class="line-numbers"><span>/execute in minecraft:theta run data get entity @e[type=pig,x=113,dx=20,y=35,dy=20,z=66,limit=1] UUID[0]</span>
</code>
        </pre></p>
<p>for the first number of the four. Now, let's work on converting it to hexadecimal. Do you remember the issue with negative numbers being \(2^{32}\) off where they needed to be? Well, this fixes that! We add \(4294967296\) to all negative numbers we get, to make them the corresponding positive number which we can then convert into hexadecimal as usual.</p>
<p>
        <pre style="position: relative;">
            <button class="copy-button" onclick="copyToClipboard(this)">Copy</button>
            <code data-language="msc" class="line-numbers"><span>    &num; half the time, this number is negative due to integer overflows.</span>
<span>    &num; this line makes it positive: 4294967296 is the unsigned 32-bit integer limit, equal to 2^32.</span>
<span>    @if currentUUID < 0</span>
<span>        @var currentUUID = Long(4294967296L + currentUUID)</span>
<span>    @fi</span>
</code>
        </pre></p>
<p>How do we convert a <code class="inline-code">Long</code> into an eight-digit hexadecimal number? We uses the fact that a hexadecimal number like <code class="inline-code">27f6a0b7</code> is really</p>
<p>
        <pre style="position: relative;">
            <button class="copy-button" onclick="copyToClipboard(this)">Copy</button>
            <code data-language="hexadecimal" class="line-numbers"><span>  (2 =  2) × (16^7 = 268435456) = 536870912</span>
<span>+ (7 =  7) × (16^6 =  16777216) = 117440512</span>
<span>+ (f = 15) × (16^5 =   1048576) =  15728640</span>
<span>+ (6 =  6) × (16^4 =     65536) =    393216</span>
<span>+ (a = 10) × (16^3 =      4096) =     40960</span>
<span>+ (0 =  0) × (16^2 =       256) =         0</span>
<span>+ (b = 11) × (16^1 =        16) =       176</span>
<span>+ (7 =  7) × (16^0 =         1) =         7</span>
<span>-------------------------------------------</span>
<span>                                = 670474423</span>
</code>
        </pre></p>
<p>and so by decomposing a number like 670474423 into the form
\[N = \sum_{i=0}^7 a_i \cdot 16^i \quad a_i \in \{0, \, 1, \, \ldots, \, 15\}\]
we can reverse this process and get the sequence of digits we need. We use a greedy algorithm to do this: for each base, take off as many as possible (maximise \(a_7\), then \(a_6\), then ...). For our specific example of \(670474423\), we would do:</p>
<p>
        <pre style="position: relative;">

<p>Let's implement this in code, using \(\mathrm{pow} = 16^i\):</p>
<p>
        <pre style="position: relative;">

<span>        &num; adds the correct hex character to the list u</span>
<span>        @var u.append(hexadecimalDigits[Int(currentUUID / pow)])</span>
<span> </span>
<span>        &num; reduces the UUID by stripping off the first hex digit (which is a subtraction in decimal)</span>
<span>        @var currentUUID = Long(currentUUID - Long(Int(currentUUID / pow) * pow))</span>

<span>    @done</span>
</code>
        </pre></p>
<p>Here, \(a_i = \) <code class="inline-code">Int(currentUUID / pow)</code> is the biggest multiple of \(16^i\) you can take off the number you're working with. This is then the next digit of the UUID in hexadecimal, so we can add it to our list (line 5 of the above code block).</p>
<p>We then need to remove it to "trim" the first hexadecimal digit. This is done with line 7. We take off <code class="inline-code">Long(Int(currentUUID / pow) * pow)</code>, which is equal to \(a_i \cdot 16^i\). This means we can repeat the process with the next largest power of 16.</p>
<p>And with that, we're pretty much done! We just need to do this for <span class="tooltip">all four parts of the UUID<span class="tooltiptext">The four integers, as Minecraft stores them.</span></span>, and we can concatenate them together to get our UUID. In fact, we get this for free. Since we're looping through in order, and each digit is just appended to the list, all four parts are <em>automatically in the right order after each other</em>. Isn't that neat?!</p>
<p>Putting this loop all together, we get</p>

<p>There's just one last thing left to do: convert the list of hexadecimal digits into a UUID, and use it to construct an <code class="inline-code">Entity</code>.</p>

<p>This just adds all the characters together, with dashes in the right places, as we mentioned earlier. Then, it makes an <code class="inline-code">Entity</code> object in MSC based on this UUID, and returns it to you. (This might be <code class="inline-code">null</code>, but it won't error - the onus is on the user to ensure their entity exists.)</p>
<p>Fantastic! The only thing left to do is to put all this code together.</p>

<p>Thanks for reading! UUIDs are pretty cool, but they're often weird and unintuitive, especially in the way Minecraft handles them. Hopefully this clears some of the weird behaviour up!</p>
