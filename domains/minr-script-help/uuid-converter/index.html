<p>You're probably familiar with UUIDs in Minecraft. They're the weird strings of numbers and letters that everyone seems to have associated with their username - you might have seen them on <a href="https://namemc.com/">NameMC</a>, for example. Mine is <code class="inline-code">e62bfa1e-f625-4ad3-9403-7e7f8e14d0f1</code>. In today's article, we're going to explore what these mean and why they're useful, and build a useful function which allows you to get them for arbitrary entities.</p>

<p><h2 id="what-is-a-uuid">What is a UUID?</p></h2>
<p>A UUID, short for <em><u>U</u>niversally <u>U</u>nique <u>ID</u>entifier</em>, is a 32-character long <a href="https://byjus.com/maths/hexadecimal-number-system/">hexadecimal</a> number with dashes to separate it into blocks of <code class="inline-code">8-4-4-4-12</code>. Hexadecimal is a number system with 16 digits (hexa = 6, deci = 10), which are 0-9 then A-F. For example, the number <code class="inline-code">23</code> in hexadecimal represents what we would think of as 35, since 35 = 2 × 16 + 3 × 1.</p>
<p>The "point" of UUIDs is that they really are unique, and you can (almost) guarantee this <em>without having to put in effort into ensuring it manually</em>. Why? Well, let's understand the structure of UUIDs to find out.</p>
<p>
        <pre style="position: relative;">
            <button class="copy-button" onclick="copyToClipboard(this)">Copy</button>
            <code data-language="uuid-v4.1" class="line-numbers"><span>xxxxxxxx-xxxx-4xxx-yxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx</span>
</code>
        </pre></p>
<p>The <code class="inline-code">4</code> in position 13 represents the version of the UUID (since Minecraft uses version 4). The <code class="inline-code">y</code> in position 17 represents the variant: Minecraft uses variant 4.1, so <span class="tooltip">this digit can be <code class="inline-code">8</code>, <code class="inline-code">9</code>, <code class="inline-code">a</code>, or <code class="inline-code">b</code><span class="tooltiptext">The two most significant bits of the nibble corresponding to the 17th hexadecimal digit are set to 10, leaving the possible values as these four: 1000, 1001, 1010, 1011.</span></span>. This specification is described in <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc4122#section-4.4">Section 4.4 of the IETF's RFC4122 document</a> from 2005.</p>
<p><strong>Every single other part of the UUID is generated completely at random.</strong></p>
<p>Why is this unique? Well, probability!</p>
<p>The 13th digit is always 4. The 17th digit can be any of 4 possibilities. The 30 other digits each have 16 possibilities. This means the number of total possible UUIDs is \( 4 \times 16^{30} = 2^{122} = 5,316,911,983,139,663,491,615,228,241,121,378,304 \), or over 5 billion billion billion billion. This is a mindblowingly large number. To put it in perspective, if you generated one UUID every second <em>since the dawn of the universe</em>, there would be an <span class="tooltip">over 98% chance<span class="tooltiptext">\&#40; \mathbb{P}&#40;\text{collision}&#41; \approx 1 - e^{-t^2/2n} \\ = 1 - e^{-1.89 \cdot 10^{35} / 2^{123}} \approx 0.0176 \&#41;</span></span> that they were <em>all</em> unique!</p>
<p>That's pretty useful! We can generate these things pretty easily and cheaply, and have a guarantee that they're unique, so we can use them as our internal references for things without worrying that something will break because we've given two things the same name.</p>
<p><h2 id="how-does-minecraft-use-uuids">How does Minecraft use UUIDs?</p></h2>
<p>Minecraft does this with every entity. This means every single entity (including players) has one of these unique codes. We often have to reference these UUIDs, for example when running pretty much every command targeting an entity, or when constructing an <code class="inline-code">Entity</code> object in MSC.</p>
<p>Sometimes we want the UUID of an entity. Let's see where it's displayed in <code class="inline-code">/data get entity</code>, tried on a minecart which I know to have a UUID of <code class="inline-code">11ac0982-00e1-4f5e-a8dc-c96258766524</code>.</p>
<p><div class="image-container"><img src="minecart.png" alt="What you see when looking at the data of an entity (here, the minecart)"><div class="caption">What you see when looking at the data of an entity (here, the minecart)</div></div></p>
<p>That's weird. It says <code class="inline-code">UUID: [I; 296487298, 14765918, -1461925534, 1484154148]</code>. That doesn't look like the format we're expecting at all!</p>
<p>However, <span class="tooltip">let's do some digging<span class="tooltiptext">Okay, I do know why this happens. However, I think it's more interesting to show the process of figuring it out!</span></span>. Here's a converter which swaps numbers back and forth between decimal and hexadecimal. (Try it yourself - you can edit the numbers on either side!)</p>
<p><label for="decimal">Decimal:</label>
<input type="text" id="decimal" oninput="convertDecToHex()" value="296487298">
<span>&#8596;</span>
<label for="hexadecimal">Hexadecimal:</label>
<input type="text" id="hexadecimal" oninput="convertHexToDec()" value="11ac0982"></p>
<p>That's interesting. <code class="inline-code">296487298</code> in decimal (the first number of the list) is <code class="inline-code">11ac0982</code> in hexadecimal (the first 8 characters of the string UUID). This obviously isn't a coincidence. The reason for this is that Minecraft stores UUIDs in a weird format which uses four 32-bit signed integers.</p>
<p>A 32-bit integer is an integer which is stored using 32 binary digits, or "bits". "Signed" means the first bit is used to denote the <em>sign</em> of a number: whether it's positive or negative.</p>
<p>
        <pre style="position: relative;">
            <button class="copy-button" onclick="copyToClipboard(this)">Copy</button>
            <code data-language="binary" class="line-numbers"><span>   1    1    a    c    0    9    8    2</span>
<span>0001 0001 1010 1100 0000 1001 1000 0010</span>
</code>
        </pre></p>
<p><code class="inline-code">00010001101011000000100110000010</code> in binary is exactly <code class="inline-code">296487298</code>. You can see how each <span class="tooltip">4 bits<span class="tooltiptext">Also known as a nibble. \&#40; 2^4 = 16 \&#41;, hence there being 4 bits: each hexadecimal digit contains \&#40; \mathrm{log}_2 &#40; 16 &#41; = 4 \&#41; times as much information as a bit.</span></span> correspond to each hexadecimal character, too.</p>
<p>However, you might notice something weird. If you put the third number, <code class="inline-code">-1461925534</code>, into the converter on the decimal side, you'll notice that it doesn't match up at all with the third octet of hexadecimal digits. We should get <code class="inline-code">a8dcc962</code>, but we get a negative number.</p>
<p>Okay, what number <em>would have</em> given us the correct answer? Sticking <code class="inline-code">a8dcc962</code> into the hexadecimal side of the converter, we get <code class="inline-code">2833041762</code>. <span class="tooltip">On a whim<span class="tooltiptext">Not really on a whim. There's obviously a reason this works, and we'll see it shortly.</span></span>, let's calculate \( 2833041762 + 1461925534 = 4294967296 = 2^{32} \). So the number we wanted is exactly </p>
