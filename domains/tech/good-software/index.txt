## Some Software I Like Using

This is a pretty incomplete list of software I think is [extremely good](!I use all of these pretty regularly, and I think those that are paid are well worth the money.). I've tried to stay away from social-media style uses and just "nice websites" - these are mostly utility-based tools. The idea is to list pieces of software which have unusually good user experiences, effectiveness, or features you can't get anywhere else.

<ul>
- [The Browser Company's Arc](https://arc.net/) - A browser made by people with attention to detail who care about user experience
- [Anthropic's Claude 3 Opus](https://claude.ai/chats) - AI assistant with fantastic design which is smart and personable
- [Last.fm](https://www.last.fm/) - Tracks every song you listen to and displays summary statistics
- [Ground News](https://ground.news/) - Groups news articles from many sources with bias ratings for each
- [TEXMaker](https://www.xm1math.net/texmaker/) - A powerful LaTeX editor with an integrated PDF viewer
- [KeyBR](https://keybr.com) - Website which allows you to practice typing and improve your speed
- [Excalidraw](https://excalidraw.com/) - Online drawing tool with useful features and a nice aesthetic
- [Fusion 360](https://www.autodesk.com/products/fusion-360/) - Easy and powerful CAD software for designing 3D prints
- [Cold Turkey Blocker](https://getcoldturkey.com/) - The most effective website and distraction blocker I've used
- [One Sec](https://one-sec.app/) - An app blocker for phones which makes you wait before opening apps
- [Alarmy](https://alar.my/) - Alarm which forces you to complete various tasks in order to turn it off
</ul>
