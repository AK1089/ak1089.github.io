## Some Software I Like Using

This is a pretty incomplete list of software I think is [extremely good](!I use all of these pretty regularly, and I think those that are paid are well worth the money.). I've tried to stay away from social-media style uses and just "nice websites" - these are mostly utility-based tools. You'll probably know most of these. They're not in any particular order.
