<p>This is a pretty incomplete list of software I think is <span class="tooltip">extremely good<span class="tooltiptext">I use all of these pretty regularly, and I think those that are paid are well worth the money.</span></span>. I've tried to stay away from social-media style uses and just "nice websites" - these are mostly utility-based tools. The idea is to list pieces of software which have unusually good user experiences, effectiveness, or features you can't get anywhere else.</p>
