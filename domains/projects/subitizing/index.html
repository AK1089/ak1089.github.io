                <h3>What is this?</h3>
                <p>
                    When you see 8-10 objects, or dots, you don't usually know how many there are until you count them.
                    Maybe you can count them quickly, or use tricks like grouping them, but you still need to count. But
                    when there are only 2-4 objects, or dots, you don't need to! You intuitively know how many there are.
                    This process of implicitly counting is called subitizing. This game will help you practice this
                    process, until recognising 17 objects is as intuitive to you as recognising 3 is.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I designed this game primarily as an experiment, to see if subitizing was a trainable skill. The
                    existing research shows that young children get better at subitizing with practice, on small numbers
                    (up to 3). But I wanted to see if adults could get better at subitizing larger numbers (up to 20) with
                    deliberate practice. Plus, I thought it would be cool to be able to look at a group of objects, and
                    immediately declare "16", while everyone else struggles to count it out explicitly.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The game is simple. You set the range of numbers you want to practice with, and the number of trials
                    you want to do for each number. Then you press Start, and the game will show you a number of dots
                    between the range you set. You have to intuit how many there are as quickly as possible, and the game
                    will tell you the correct answer. Each count comes up a fixed number of times, as given by
                    "Trials per number".
                </p>
                <p>
                    <u>You only press the last digit of the number of dots.</u> So if you see 8 dots, you press 8. If
                    you see 12 dots, you press 2. The game will be generous, and assume you mistook 18 dots for 17 (not 7).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Keep track of your progress with the progress bar, and see your stats at the end of a session.
                     You can also export your stats to a CSV file, to keep track of your progress over time.
