### Games

I make games sometimes, usually for my own purposes. But anyone is free to play them.
<ul>
- [Subitizing Trainer](subitizing) (published 03/07/2024): a minigame which trains your ability to recognise counts without explicit enumeration.
</ul>

### Microsites

I like making mini websites which accomplish random tasks, display cool things, or host minigames. These are often not very polished, but work to fulfil their purpose!

<ul>
- [Ghost Word Checker](../../../ghost-word-checker) (published 14/04/2024): a word checker for the word game [Ghost](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghost_%28game%29) and its variants.
- [Infinity Loop](../../../infinity-loop) (published 03/04/2024): a level editor for games like [this one](https://poki.com/en/g/infinity-loop). Made while designing the eponymous Minr map.
- [Minr Collaborations Map](../../../minrcollabs) (published 02/02/2024): a map showing everyone on Minr's connections through working on maps together.
