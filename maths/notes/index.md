This page holds a collection of lecture notes for various Cambridge Mathematics courses, taken during Part II of the Mathematical Tripos. These notes are unofficial and may contain errors. While they are written and published with permission, they are not endorsed by the lecturer or University.

Source code for each file is available at the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/AK1089/maths-notes). Comments and corrections can be emailed to me at `ak2461@cam.ac.uk`.

Note that the material present in each course changes each year, sometimes substantially. Take care, especially if you are using these years into the future!

I would like to thank the lecturers who created and taught all these interesting courses and allowed me to publish these notes.

## Michaelmas 2024--25
