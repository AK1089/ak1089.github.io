This page holds a collection of lecture notes for various Cambridge Mathematics courses, taken during Part II of the Mathematical Tripos. These notes are unofficial and may contain errors. While they are written and published with permission, they are not endorsed by the lecturer or University.

Source code for each file is available at the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/AK1089/maths-notes). Comments and corrections can be emailed to me at `ak2461@cam.ac.uk`.

Note that the material present in each course changes each year, sometimes substantially. Take care, especially if you are using these years into the future!

I would like to thank the lecturers who created and taught all these interesting courses and allowed me to publish these notes.

## Other Notes Repositories

The [Maths Department's official page](https://www.maths.cam.ac.uk/undergrad/studentreps/tripos-specific-resources) has a collection of official notes. However, many other students have similarly produced typeset lecture notes, which are often very good. I link to a few of them here, in case you are looking for courses which I don't have on this page.

1. [Dexter Chua](https://dec41.user.srcf.net/notes/): SRCF website, very extensive collection
2. [Sky Wilshaw](https://zeramorphic.uk/maths.html): personal website, very extensive collection
3. [King Ming Lam](https://1drv.ms/f/s!AtFdZ6-agiAQky4Y2DSTwhZeT7ha): OneDrive folder, exclusively IA and IB
4. [Adam Kelly](https://ak2316.user.srcf.net/lecture-notes/): SRCF website, primarily IA and IB
5. [Bhavik Mehta](https://github.com/b-mehta/maths-notes): GitHub repository, exclusively II and III
6. [Gareth Taylor](https://tartarus.org/gareth/maths/notes/): (yes, *that* Gareth Taylor!) personal website, very old
