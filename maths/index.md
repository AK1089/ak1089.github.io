I've been a huge mathematics nerd since I was very young: throughout my schooling days, I was an avid participant in the [UKMT Challenges](https://ukmt.org.uk/), and received several medals and prizes. As of 2024, I study Mathematics at the undergraduate level at the University of Cambridge. This page catalogues anything mathematical I've written, resources, and things of interest I suggest reading.

## Probability

- A [complete catalogue of probability distributions](probability-distributions).
- An [explainer](laplaces-rule-of-succession) and [interactive model](laplaces-rule-of-succession/interactive) of Laplace's Rule of Succession.
