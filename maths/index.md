I've been a huge mathematics nerd since I was very young: throughout my schooling days, I was an avid participant in the [UKMT Challenges](https://ukmt.org.uk/), and received several medals and prizes. This page catalogues anything mathematical I've written, resources, and things of interest I suggest reading.

I read Mathematics at the undergraduate level at the University of Cambridge, graduating in 2025. I have publicised some lecture notes from Part II courses: these are available [here](notes).

## Probability

- A complete [catalogue](probability-distributions) of probability distributions.
- An [explainer](laplaces-rule-of-succession) and [interactive model](laplaces-rule-of-succession/interactive) of Laplace's Rule of Succession.
- An [article](tail-events) about Chebyshev's inequality and extreme tail events (black swans).

## Foundations

- A taxonomy of real numbers, which I call the [number zoo](the-number-zoo).
