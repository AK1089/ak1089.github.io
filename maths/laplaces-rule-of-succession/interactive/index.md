# Laplace's Rule of Succession

An interactive demonstration of Laplace's Rule of Succession, a principle in probability theory for estimating future outcomes based on observed data.
For the full mathematical explanation, see the main Laplace's Rule of Succession page at https://ak1089.github.io/maths/laplaces-rule-of-succession/

The entire content of the page is a large embedded graph from Desmos. This can be found at https://www.desmos.com/calculator/b4lbmtm4ks

The graph contains two sliders to control the number of observations and the number of successes among them. It shows the posterior distribution after these observations, and marks the mean of this distribution as well as its peak, demonstrating that these are not in general the same.
