# Laplace's Rule of Succession - Interactive Demo

An interactive demonstration of Laplace's Rule of Succession, a principle in probability theory for estimating future outcomes based on observed data.

This interactive tool allows you to:
- Visualize how prior beliefs are updated with observed data
- Experiment with different sequences of coin flips or events
- See how Bayesian inference affects probability estimates
- Understand the mathematical principles behind Laplace's Rule

For the full mathematical explanation, see the main [Laplace's Rule of Succession page](https://ak1089.github.io/maths/laplaces-rule-of-succession/).

This is a custom interactive visualization for educational purposes.
