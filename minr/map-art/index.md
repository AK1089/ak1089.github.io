# Map Art Maker

A tool for creating Minecraft map art. This interactive application helps users convert images into Minecraft map art by processing uploaded images and generating the appropriate blocks and colors.

The user may upload any image. It is processed to turn it into a 128x128 square (the size of a standard Minecraft map) and recoloured to use the standard Minecraft colour palette. A script which runs in-game to place blocks in such a way as to recreate this colours is generated. This is turned into a random code given to the user, which they can input in-game to run the script and give them a map.
