# Minr Collaborations Map

This is an interactive network visualisation showing the collaborations between members of the Minr community.
Each of the nodes is a player who has made a map on Minr. Edges denote a collaboration between multiple people, with larger nodes for more collaborative mapmakers and thicker lines for repeated collaborations among a pair.

The nodes can be dragged around and spring back together. There is a search bar to find specific creators, which brings up a panel showing their collaborators. Clicking on a node also brings up this panel, as well as highlighting the collaborators on the graph.
