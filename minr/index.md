I spend a lot of time on [Zero.Minr.Org](https://forums.minr.org/), one of the oldest Minecraft servers around (since 2010). It's a challenge server, designed for mapmakers to build puzzles, mazes, parkour, and adventure maps. I've been around on the server since June 2020, and have been a staff member since February 2022. The server IP is `zero.minr.org` and the [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/minr) is `discord.gg/minr`.

One of the biggest features of the server is a completely custom plugin, which includes Minr Script Code: a full programming language built into Minecraft to facilitate mapmaking. This is an extremely powerful tool, and I've done a lot of interesting things with it. Most of the pages under this section are devoted to scripting, including some guides I've written, links to useful resources, example scripts, and other tools I've created to help with mapmaking.

## My Tools

- My [map art creator](map-art) allows you to upload images and view them as custom maps in game.

## Links to External Resources

Some links to the Minr forums are restricted to <span style="color: var(--lime)">Greenies</span> and above.

- Eszes BÃ¡lint's [BDStudio](https://eszesbalint.github.io/bdstudio/editor) is a powerful GUI editor for working with block displays.
- [MCStacker](https://mcstacker.net/) is an incredibly capable custom command builder which requires very little knowledge of commands.
- The [official MSC documentation](https://msc-documentation.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) is worth reading if you are starting out with scripting.
- `Lightwood13` has developed a [VSCode extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Lightwood13.msc) which helps with writing MSC scripts. I think it's fantastic, and well worth the setup investment.
- `rmanimal` wrote [Scripts with rman](https://forums.minr.org/threads/scripts-with-rman-1-basic-script-understanding.3193/) in 2018, and it still holds up as the canonical tutorial-style introduction to scripting.
- `egabbac` maintains a [collection of resources](https://forums.minr.org/threads/compilation-of-mapmaking-resources.7331/) which aim to help with mapmaking.
- On the server, `/warp teleport mapmaking` has a guide to many aspects of creating maps.
