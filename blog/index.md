This is where I plan to publish more personal and less technical writing. These will usually be less structured pieces, wildly varying in both their length and quality. I have not yet written anything for this area of the site, but when I do they will be organised here by approximate category.

Things to expect from the blog: philosophy, travel, thoughts on politics, new things I've discovered, fun facts, non-technical discussion of tech like AI, deep dives into areas I find interesting, things I recommend reading, and anything which my [Twitter / X account](https://x.com/_AK1089_) isn't well-suited for.
