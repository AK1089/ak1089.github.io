Welcome! My name is Avish, and this is my personal site for things I make or find interesting. I'm 20 years old, born and raised in London, and am currently in my final year of pursuing an undergraduate Maths degree at the University of Cambridge.

In my free time, I enjoy programming, reading, making and solving puzzles, social deduction games, board games, playing on Minr, and creating things. Online, I often go by AK1089, after my initials and [favourite number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1089_%28number%29#In_magic). You can find me at the social links down on the left.

## What's Here

See the site sections on the sidebar, or view everything from the [site map](map). Popular pages include:
 
- My [collection of puzzles](/puzzles) of various genres
- My [mathematics lecture notes](/maths/notes)
- Minr-specific utilities I've built, especially the [map art creator](/minr/map-art)

## Site Features

I designed this site myself, using vanilla <span style="color: #e34c26">HTML</span>,  <span style="color: #c4b018">JavaScript</span>, and  <span style="color: #264de4">CSS</span>.  I use a custom Markdown parser to convert my written content into formatted HTML which meets my specifications. You can see all the code for this website [here](https://github.com/AK1089/ak1089.github.io), or read more about my design principles, choices, and influences [here](/other/design).
