Welcome! My name is Avish, and this is my personal site for things I make or find interesting. I'm 20 years old, born and raised in London, and am currently in my final year of pursuing an undergraduate degree in mathematics at the University of Cambridge.

In my free time, I enjoy programming, reading, making and solving puzzles, social deduction games, board games, playing on Minr, and creating things. On the internet, I often go by AK1089, after my initials and [favourite number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1089_%28number%29#In_magic). You can find me at any of the social links down on the left.

# Site Features

I designed this site myself, using vanilla HTML, JavaScript, and CSS.  I use a custom Markdown parser to convert my written content into formatted HTML which meets my specifications. You can see all the code for this website [here](https://github.com/AK1089/ak1089.github.io), or read more about my design principles, choices, and influences [here](/other/design).

Some design features available include <span style="color: var(--red)">coloured text</span>, and code blocks like this:

```python
# Let's do a code block!
def function(x: int):
    return x + 5
```
