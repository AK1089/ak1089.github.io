Welcome! My name is Avish, and this is my personal site for things I make or find interesting. I'm 21 years old, born and raised in London, and am currently working as a quantitative researcher in Amsterdam.

In my free time, I enjoy programming, reading, making and solving puzzles, social deduction games, board games, playing on Minr, and creating things. Online, I often go by AK1089, after my initials and [favourite number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1089_%28number%29#In_magic). You can find me at the social links down on the left.

## What's Here

See the site sections on the sidebar, or view everything from the [site map](map). Popular pages include:
 
- My [collection of puzzles](/puzzles) of various genres
- My [lecture notes](/maths/notes) from Part II Mathematics at Cambridge
- Minr-specific utilities I've built, especially the [map art creator](/minr/map-art)
- My [collection of fun facts](/other/fun-facts) spanning science, history, and more

## Site Features

I designed this site myself, using vanilla <span style="color: #e34c26">HTML</span>,  <span style="color: #c4b018">JavaScript</span>, and  <span style="color: #264de4">CSS</span>.  I use a custom Markdown parser to convert my written content into formatted HTML which meets my specifications. You can see all the code for this website [here](https://github.com/AK1089/ak1089.github.io), or read more about my design principles, choices, and influences [here](/other/design).
