Welcome! My name is Avish, and this is my personal site for things I make or find interesting. I'm 20 years old, born and raised in London, and am currently in my final year of pursuing an undergraduate degree in mathematics at the University of Cambridge. In my free time, I enjoy programming, reading, making and solving puzzles, social deduction games, board games, playing on Minr, and creating things. On the internet, I often go by AK1089, after my initials and [favourite number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1089_%28number%29#In_magic).

```python
