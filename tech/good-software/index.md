This is a pretty incomplete list of software I think is extremely good. I use all of these pretty regularly, and I think those that are paid are well worth the money. I've tried to stay away from social-media style uses and just "nice websites" - these are mostly utility-based tools. The idea is to list pieces of software which have unusually good user experiences, effectiveness, or features you can't get anywhere else.

1. The Browser Company's [Arc](https://arc.net/) - A modern browser with neat organisation and good aesthetics
1. [Last.fm](https://www.last.fm/home) - A site which tracks every song you listen to with summary statistics and a free API
1. [Texifier](https://www.texifier.com/) - The best LaTeX editor I've ever used, with live typesetting and a customisable layout
1. [KeyBR](https://www.keybr.com/) - A website for typing speed practice which is effective at training and improvement
