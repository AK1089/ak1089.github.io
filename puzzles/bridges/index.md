You and an adversary (the computer) are stuck on an archipelago of ten islands. You take turns moving the red token to a neighbouring island across a bridge, destroying the bridge in the process. If one of you is ever unable to make a move, you lose.

The objective is to beat the computer by moving to an island which has no more bridges (after the one you use is destroyed in the process).
