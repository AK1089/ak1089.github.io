I originally created this puzzle as a round in a quiz I hosted for a few friends in early 2021. Some of the answers were specific in-group knowledge, and others were too easy, so I have edited this puzzle slightly from the original version.

Each round consists of five clues, with each clue corresponding to a number: all numbers within a round are similar in size. Your task is to sort the clues by the number they represent, smallest to largest.

# Questions

All five numbers are within 1% of the median.

1. Dystopian 📖
1. Taylor Swift

## Round 2

All five numbers are within 20% of the median.

1. Car race, IN
1. Average time from ☀️ to 🌍 for 💡 (s)
1. 🌡️ at which paper burns (ºF)

1. Error: This Clue Not Found

All five numbers are within 10% of the median.

1. White Supremacy
1. m/mi
1. Fe Solid to Liquid, ºC

## Round 4

All five numbers are within 25% of the median.
