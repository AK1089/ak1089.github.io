        <h1>The Father and the Coins</h1>
        <p><strong>These are not trick questions.</strong></p>
        <p>
          Your father tells you that long ago, he had two partners named Heather
          and Talia. He wanted to have children but couldn&rsquo;t decide with
          whom; he resolved to leave it up to chance. He decided to flip his
          lucky coin (which is a fair coin), with the intention to:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>have children with both women if the coin came up heads, or</li>
          <li>
            have children with only one if the coin came up tails, flipping the
            coin again to decide with whom (heads for Heather, tails for Talia).
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>He tells you that in fact you were born as a result of this.</p>
        <h3>Question 1</h3>
        <p>
          What is the chance that all those years ago, the first coin flip came
          up Heads?
        </p>
        <p>
          Answer:
          <span class="spoiler"
            ><span
              >Of course, the chance of a fair coin landing heads is 50%.</span
            ></span
          >
        </p>
        <h3>Question 2</h3>
        <p>
          Suppose that you know that your mother is Heather. What is the chance
          that you have a half-sibling?
        </p>
        <p>
          Answer:
          <span class="spoiler"
            ><span
              >The coin flips were either Heads (50%, in which case you have a
              half-sibling), or Tails-Heads (25%, in which case you do not).
              Tails-Tails is impossible, as you would not have been born. The
              answer is therefore two in three.</span
            ></span
          >
        </p>
        <h3>Question 3</h3>
        <p>
          Suppose that you know that your mother is Talia. What is the chance
          that you have a half-sibling?
        </p>
        <p>
          Answer:
          <span class="spoiler"
            ><span
              >There was nothing special about either possible mother: the
              chance is still two in three, by the exact same logic as in the
              previous question.</span
            ></span
          >
        </p>
        <h3>Question 4</h3>
        <p>
          Suppose you were abandoned at birth and do not know the name of your
          mother. What is the chance that you have a half-sibling?
        </p>
        <p>
          Answer:
          <span class="spoiler"
            ><span
              >The chance is still two in three: it does not change regardless
              of who your mother is, so finding out cannot possibly change your
              belief in the probability.</span
            ></span
          >
        </p>
        <h3>Question 5</h3>
        <p>
          Relate the outcome of the coin flips to you having or not having a
          half-sibling. Under what circumstances do you have a half-sibling?
        </p>
        <p>
          Answer:
          <span class="spoiler"
            ><span
              >You have a half-sibling if and only if your father had a child
              with both women: that is, if the first coin came up Heads.</span
            ></span
          >
        </p>
        <h3>Question 6</h3>
        <p>
          What is the chance that all those years ago, the first coin flip came
          up Heads?
        </p>
        <p>
          Answer:
          <span class="spoiler"
            ><span
              >Of course, this is the chance of you having had a half-sibling,
              which we calculated in question 4 to be two in three.</span
            ></span
