I am a huge fan of all sorts of puzzles, with a special fondness for logic puzzles with a mathematical flair as well as word and grid puzzles. Interviews for quantitative trading jobs are full of these sorts of brainteasers, which is one reason I love the industry so much.

## Logic Puzzles

These are puzzles in a clearly defined environment, usually based onÂ deducing a unique answer satisfying a set of logical constraints. These puzzles are often considered the "purest": there is no trickery and the solution is always possible to get using only the answer in the question.

- A difficult puzzle based on finding [ten numbers](ten-numbers) which answer ten interlinked questions.

## Probability

This is one of my favourite areas of mathematics, so there's no surprise a lot of puzzles are about probability. These are often about estimating the probability or expected value of some event given information.

- Some easy introductory puzzles about [anthropics](anthropics).
- A puzzle about cracking [five locks](five-locks) by pure chance.

## State Exploration

These are puzzles in which you are in a fixed ideal environment with some latent unknown variable, and must find an algorithm to deduce the variable given a set of exploratory actions.

- Deduce the number of carriages while trapped on a [circular train](circular-train).

## Strategy Finding

Given a competitive game with fixed rules, can you find a strategy to always win? Given a cooperative setup with limited communication bandwidth, can you find a strategy to always win with your partner?
