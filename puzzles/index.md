I'm a huge fan of all sorts of puzzles (especially logic puzzles with a mathematical flair). As an enthusiast and sometimes-creator of escape rooms, I love creating various types of original puzzleâ€”some of them which work online are exhibited here, as well as non-original puzzles I have heard elsewhere and loved.

**Logic Puzzles**:Â deduce the unique answer satisfying a set of constraints in a pure environment.

- Find [ten numbers](ten-numbers) which answer ten interlinked questions.
- Determine the behaviour of three mystery [logic gates](logic-gates).

**State Exploration**:

Design an algorithm to prod at your environment and deduce some critical feature.

- Deduce the number of carriages while trapped on a [circular train](circular-train).

**Word Puzzles**: match patterns in words, arrange letters, find words which meet constraints, and so on.

- [Bracket City](bracket-city), a clone of [the original](https://www.theatlantic.com/games/bracket-city/) so that I can make and share my own.
