# AK1089's Site

Hey, I'm Avish, a [${current_age_in_years}](!${current_age_in_days}) year old from London,
and this is my personal site! I go by AK1089 on the internet, after my initials and
[my favourite number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1089_%28number%29#In_magic).
I'm currently an undergraduate maths student at the University of Cambridge, in the UK.
I built this site myself, as a home for projects, writing, guides, and anything else I feel like putting out here.

## About This Website

I wrote the HTML, CSS, and Javascript for this website myself. To make editing the site easier, I wrote a custom Markdown-like
parser in Python, which converts relatively vanilla text files into fully formatted HTML. It supports the default Markdown syntax
for things like *italics*, **bold**, __underlined text__, and [website links](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ).

It also has things like [hover text](!ta-da!), [spoiler]spoiler blocks,[/spoiler], code blocks,
```python
def code_block_example():
    print("Hello, World!")
```
<ol> 
- lists
- with multiple items
</ol>
which can be numbered, like that, or
<ul> 
- unnumbered
- like this.
</ul>
It also supports <&red>coloured</&red> <&blue>text</&blue> and  `inline_code` blocks, as well as dynamically loaded content
(eg. you loaded this page at ${current_date}).

Thanks to the wonderful work of [Katex](https://katex.org/), it also supports beautiful LaTeX expressions, like 
\[ \mathbb{P} \left( |X-\mu| \geq k \sigma \right) \leq \frac{1}{k^2} \quad \text{(Chebyshev's Inequality)}\]
