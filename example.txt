# AK1089's Site

Hey, I'm Avish, and this is my personal site! I go by AK1089 on the internet, after my initials and
[my favourite number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1089_%28number%29#In_magic).
Originally from London, I'm currently an undergraduate maths student at the University of Cambridge, in the UK.
I built this site myself, as a home for projects, writing, guides, and anything else I feel like putting out here.

## About This Website

I wrote the HTML, CSS, and Javascript for this website myself. To make editing the site easier, I wrote a custom Markdown-like
parser in Python, which converts relatively vanilla text files into fully formatted HTML.

*Italic Text*

__Underlined Text__

[url](https://example.com)

[hover over this text](!ta-da!)

### Code Block

```python
def hello_world():
    print("Hello, World!")
```

### Spoiler

[spoiler]This is a spoiler. Hover to reveal.[/spoiler]

### Numbering

<ol> 
- Hello
- Yeah
- Abc
</ol>

new thing not in the list which has <&red>coloured text</&red> because I can do that now

I can also do `inline code` wahoo

### Dynamically Loaded Content

${variable_content}

For example, I am [${current_age_in_years}](!${current_age_in_days}) years old.

Here's some inline LaTeX: \(x^2 + y^2 = r^2\)

And here's some in display mode:
\[\mathbb{P} \left( |X-\mu| \geq \varepsilon \right) = \frac{2}{\sigma^2}\]
