## RCSA Chair Policy Commitment

### Welcome!

Hey there! My name is Avish Kumar, I'm a [second-year](!Well, I'll be third-year by the time I take office.) maths student, and I'm running to take over from my dear friend TomÃ¡s as RCSA Chair for the first half of Michaelmas 2024. To be honest, I didn't really expect anyone to type out this link, what with the woke mob silencing me.

Hereâ€™s what you need to know about my plans to revolutionise the RCSA. Remember to vote for me in the Chair Elections - the fate of the RCSA depends on it.

### Vision

Imagine a world where the RCSA is run *by* the people, *for* the people - where things are done for the benefit of everyone rather than solely in favour of entrenched interests like [Treacherous TomÃ¡s](!Again, a very good friend of mine, and overall lovely person who has served the RCSA well.) who pay no heed to the common student's interests. I think that sounds kind of boring, so I probably won't go that far. But I'll try and un-entrench some interests on my way.

### My Policy Goals

#### Efficient Elections
<ul>
- The fastest and smoothest elections in history.
- No more [unnecessary delays](!Things like "recounting the votes" and "ensuring fairness" will be skipped.) â€“ because who has time for that? 
</ul>

#### Communication and Engagement
<ul>
- Say goodbye to spam emails, like this one.
</ul>
[&Seriously, come on. Who cares?](email.png)
<ul>
- And this one.
</ul>

#### Transparency and Accountability
<ul>
- This one is important to me.
- I often ask people "what do you think about the college scandal?" - you know the most common response I get? "What college scandal?"
- Right now, the deep state is doing their best to keep all their misdeeds under wraps. And it's working!
- They'll kill me for this, if it comes to that. They've tried already! They'll kill me.
</ul>

### Promises

<ol>
- No more corruption, nepotism, favoritism, and all other nasty -isms. Except the one, of course! ðŸ˜‰
- Say goodbye to the dreaded Â£2000 college tax increase on student loans. You know the one, the one they're hiding.
- Hasta la vista, gangs of miscrents taking advantage of our dear RCSA. You know who you are.
</ol>

and various other common-sense reforms. It's time for someone who *actually cares*, rather than someone who just wants to make things worse.

### Endorsed by

**William McLaughlin**, RCSA Vice-President â€“ The real deal.

**Abhinav Ramisetty**, Blues Cricket â€“ He knows whatâ€™s up.

**TomÃ¡s Mayorga**, [RCSA Chair](!For now.) - Off on a grand adventure, but leaving the RCSA in good hands (mine).

**Barack Obama** â€“ In fact, he reached out to *me* to ask if he could endorse me!
