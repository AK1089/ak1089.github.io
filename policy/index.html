<p><h3 id="welcome">Welcome!</p></h3>
<p>Hey there! My name is Avish Kumar, I'm a <span class="tooltip">second-year<span class="tooltiptext">Well, I'll be third-year by the time I take office.</span></span> maths student, and I'm running to take over from my dear friend TomÃ¡s as RCSA Chair for the first half of Michaelmas 2024. To be honest, I didn't really expect anyone to type out this link, what with the woke mob silencing me.</p>
<p>Hereâ€™s what you need to know about my plans to revolutionise the RCSA. Remember to vote for me in the Chair Elections - the fate of the RCSA depends on it.</p>
<p><h3 id="vision">Vision</p></h3>
<p>Imagine a world where the RCSA is run <em>by</em> the people, <em>for</em> the people - where things are done for the benefit of everyone rather than solely in favour of entrenched interests like <span class="tooltip">Treacherous TomÃ¡s<span class="tooltiptext">Again, a very good friend of mine, and overall lovely person who has served the RCSA well.</span></span> who pay no heed to the common student's interests. I think that sounds kind of boring, so I probably won't go that far. But I'll try and un-entrench some interests on my way.</p>
<p><h3 id="my-policy-goals">My Policy Goals</p></h3>
<p><h4 id="efficient-electi">Efficient Elections</h4>
<ul>
<li>The fastest and smoothest elections in history.</li>
<li>No more <span class="tooltip">unnecessary delays<span class="tooltiptext">Things like "recounting the votes" and "ensuring fairness" will be skipped.</span></span> â€“ because who has time for that? </li>
</ul></p>
<p><h4 id="communication-and-engagem">Communication and Engagement</h4>
<ul>
<li>Say goodbye to spam emails, like this one.</li>
</ul>
<div class="image-container"><img src="email.png" alt="Seriously, come on. Who cares?"><div class="caption">Seriously, come on. Who cares?</div></div>
<ul>
<li>And this one.</li>
</ul>
<div class="image-container"><img src="email2.png" alt="9.17am. This one woke me up!"><div class="caption">9.17am. This one woke me up!</div></div></p>
<p><h4 id="transparency-and-accountabil">Transparency and Accountability</h4>
<ul>
<li>This one is important to me.</li>
<li>I often ask people "what do you think about the college scandal?" - you know the most common response I get? "What college scandal?"</li>
<li>Right now, the deep state is doing their best to keep all their misdeeds under wraps. And it's working!</li>
<li>They'll kill me for this, if it comes to that. They've tried already! They'll kill me.</li>
</ul></p>
<p><h3 id="promises">Promises</p></h3>
<p><ol>
<li>No more corruption, nepotism, favoritism, and all other nasty -isms. Except the one, of course! ðŸ˜‰</li>
<li>Say goodbye to the dreaded Â£2000 college tax increase on student loans. You know the one, the one they're hiding.</li>
<li>Hasta la vista, gangs of miscrents taking advantage of our dear RCSA. You know who you are.</li>
</ol></p>
<p>and various other common-sense reforms. It's time for someone who <em>actually cares</em>, rather than someone who just wants to make things worse.</p>
<p><h3 id="endorsed-by">Endorsed by</p></h3>
<p><strong>William McLaughlin</strong>, RCSA Vice-President â€“ The real deal.</p>
<p><strong>Abhinav Ramisetty</strong>, Blues Cricket â€“ He knows whatâ€™s up.</p>
<p><strong>TomÃ¡s Mayorga</strong>, <span class="tooltip">RCSA Chair<span class="tooltiptext">For now.</span></span> - Off on a grand adventure, but leaving the RCSA in good hands (mine).</p>
<p><strong>Barack Obama</strong> â€“ In fact, he reached out to <em>me</em> to ask if he could endorse me!</p>
<p><div class="image-container"><img src="signatures.png" alt="All my loyal supporters. Thank you for believing in me!"><div class="caption">All my loyal supporters. Thank you for believing in me!</div></div></p>
<p><h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</p></h3>
<p>Thanks for reading, and letâ€™s make the RCSA great again!</p>
<p>Vote <u>Avish Kumar</u> for RCSA Chair on Friday June 14 2024.</p>
<p>(Download my manifesto <a href="Avish-Kumar-Manifesto.pdf" download>here</a>, or contact me <a href="mailto:ak2461@cam.ac.uk">here</a>. I am mentally healthy and have no intentions of committing suicide: if I die in suspicious circumstances then investigate TomÃ¡s Mayorga.)</p>
